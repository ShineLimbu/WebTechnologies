                <strong>Mike Tyson</strong> Michael Gerard Tyson (born June 30, 1966) is an American former professional
                 boxer who competed from 1985 to 2005. Nicknamed "Iron Mike"[4] and
                  "Kid Dynamite" in his early career, and later known as "The Baddest 
                  Man on the Planet",[5] Tyson is considered to be one of the greatest
                   heavyweight boxers of all time.[6] He reigned as the undisputed
                 world heavyweight champion from 1987 to 1990. Tyson won his first 19
                  professional fights by knockout, 12 of them in the first round. 
                 Claiming his first belt at 20 years, four months, and 22 days old, 
                Tyson holds the record as the youngest boxer ever to win a heavyweight
                 title.[7] He was the first heavyweight boxer to simultaneously hold 
                 the WBA, WBC and IBF titles, as well as the only heavyweight to unify
                  them in succession</h3></dt>

            Tyson was The Ring magazine's Fighter of the Year in 1986 and 
            1988.[161] A 1998 ranking of "The Greatest Heavyweights of
             All-Time" by The Ring magazine placed Tyson at number 14 on 
             the list.[162] Despite criticism of facing underwhelming 
             competition during his run as champion, Tyson's knockout power 
             and intimidation factor made him the sport's most dynamic 
             box-office draw. According to Douglas Quenqua of The New York 
             Times, "The [1990s] began with Mike Tyson, considered by many 
             to be the last great heavyweight champion, losing his title to
              the little-known Buster Douglas. Seven years later, Mr. Tyson
               bit Evander Holyfield's ear in a heavyweight champion 
               boutâ€”hardly a proud moment for the sport."

            <code>As an amateur, Tyson won gold medals at the 1981 and 1982
             Junior Olympic Games, defeating Joe Cortez in 1981 and beating 
             Kelton Brown in 1982. Brown's corner threw in the towel in the 
             first round. In 1984 Tyson won the gold medal at the Nation.
            Golden Gloves held in New York, beating Jonathan Littles. He
             fought Henry Tillman twice as an amateur, losing both bouts 
             by decision. Tillman went on to win heavyweight gold at the
              1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.
